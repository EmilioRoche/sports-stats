# Demo for simple React/NodeJS App

## Why?

* I built this project because I wanted to get more experience building a front-end application that can be deployed to a [hosted site](https://emilioroche.github.io/sports-stats/) using Github Pages, as well creating a back-end that can make PostgreSQL queries to my Heroku Postgres Database to create any api endpoints based on the endpoints that I hit on the front side (backend is hosted on Heroku Cloud). 

* The [front-end](https://github.com/EmilioRoche/sports-stats) and [back-end](https://github.com/EmilioRoche/sports-stats-api) are separated into 2 repos.

* I wasn't too concerned on building an aesthetically pleasing UI, as I really just wanted to make sure I focused on functionality over looks.
